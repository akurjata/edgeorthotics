<div class="w3-container w3-pale-yellow" style="padding:25px 16px" id="orthotics">
<h2 class="w3-center">Are orthotics right for me?</h2><br>
<div class="w3-row-padding">
<div class="w3-col m6"> 
 <p class="w3-large">Recently, the term "orthotic" has been used to simply mean "an arch support of some sort." These "orthotics" are generally an off-the-shelf item that is not truly custom made to fit your foot or address your specific needs; no biomechanical assessment is taken, and no certified foot specialist does an assessment to see whether orthotics are required. These inserts generally improve the cushioning in footwear, but do not alter foot position and cannot truly address biomechanical issues or injuries. In short, though they are labelled "orthotics" they are not what we at Edge Orthotics, would refer to as "orthotics."</p>

<p class="w3-large">Orthotics (medical name: Orthoses) are custom made inserts created from a mold of your foot. They are a medical device that is designed <b>specifically for you</b> by a Canadian Certified Pedorthist or other health care professional who is certified to make orthotics. Orthotics are meant to address a specific foot or lower limb injury or biomechanical fault. In order to get properly fitted for an orthotic, a full assessment of your foot mechanics, position and problem must be done by a certified heathcare professional and a three-dimensional mold of your foot must be taken.
</p>
              
<p class="w3-large">At Edge Orthotics, we build semi-flexible orthotics from a custom, three-dimensional mold of your foot. All custom orthotics are hand made in our Prince George orthotics lab by our on-staff Canadian certified pedorthists. We do not believe that you need to "break your feet in" to our orthotics; while it is normal for new orthotics to feel strange, they should not cause you any new pain. </p>

    <div class="w3-col m6"> <p>
Born and raised in Prince George, Shalina knows the importance of being on your feet to enjoy everything Northern B.C. has to offer.  
</p>
<p>
  Starting with her work in a speciality shoe shop, she has been helping people in the region stay mobile from the ground up for nearly twenty years.
      </p>      
 <p>
  Shalina became a pedorthist after apprenticing with Brian Farrance, an athletic therapist and pedorthist in Prince George who has worked with teams at the Canada Winter Games, Pan American Games and Olympic Games.
      </p> 
                                                                                          </div>

      <p>
  After earning her certification, Shalina joined Brian Farrance Orthotics, where she took a special interest in helping people manage workplace and athletic injuries, diabetic complications, and chronic pain.
      </p> 
     <p>
With Brian moving into retirement, Shalina is proud to bring the same tradition of service and expertise that people in Prince George have come to expect.
      </p>

When she's not seeing patients or in the lab, Shalina is likely exploring the many hiking, walking and cross-country ski trails in the region.

  <h4>How long will a visit take?
</h4>
<p>While everyone is different, your first appointment will usually take about thirty minutes. Please bring the shoes you wear the most, so we can get a full picture of your daily activity.
<br><br>
If you move forward with getting orthotics, the follow-up visit will take about fifteen minutes. 
<br><br>
You can schedule visits by phone Monday to Wednesday between 8 am and 4 pm.<br><br>

       <h4>When will I get my orthotics?
</h4>
<p>
  First, it is important to let you know that we will only recommend orthotics if we think they can help. If we believe some other solution is available, we will recommend that - if you donâ€™t need them, we wonâ€™t build them.
 <br><br>
Should orthotics be the right fit for you, we strive to have them ready within two weeks of your initial appointment.<br>
  <br><em>Note: Due to COVID-19 restrictions, orthotics are now available two to four weeks after your initial visit.</em>

      <h4>Can someone else pick up my orthotics for me?</h4>
      <p>No. To ensure that your orthotics fit properly and feel good, we like to finish them in the office by measuring them to your feet, showing you how to adjust your shoe to fit the orthotics and making sure that they fit in your footwear. The orthotics are custom built for you, so we need you there for this final step. 
        <br><br>If it is impossible for you to return to pick up your orthotics we can do our best to finish them and have shipping arranged, however we strongly advise against this.

  <h4>If they're made to fit my feet, why do orthotics feel weird?</h4>
  <p>Orthotics provide your foot with full contact, wrapping around the heel and filling in the arch. Most feet have never had anything provide them with this much contact before. Like a finger that has never had a ring on it, your foot may need some time to adjust.

       <h4>My orthotics hurt my feet. What should I do?</h4>
 <p>That means that they need adjusting. Some feet are more sensitive than others, and as little as 1mm of extra material can make the difference between pain and comfort for some feet. You need to make an appointment and come back for a visit. A quick 15 minute adjustment will help get you back on your feet, and on your way to feeling great - no need to worry about extra fees - there is no additional charge for adjustments!

    <h4>Why are you only open three days a week?</h4>
<p>
  Because we are building orthotics especially for you, our process takes a little longer. Rather than outsourcing, the pedorthist you visit is the same person who will build your orthotics. This means on the days we arenâ€™t seeing patients, we are in the lab making the products you need to get back on your feet.
